abstract = "This paper describes the Purdue University Supercomputing 2018 (SC18) Student Cluster Competition (SCC) team’s methods for reproducing Uphoff et al.’s paper, “Extreme Scale Multi-Physics Simulations of the Tsunamigenic 2004 Sumatra Megathrust Earthquake”, from the SC17 proceedings. The paper focuses on SeisSol, a seismic wave phenomena and earthquake dynamics software designed for massively parallel systems. During the SCC, the Purdue University team reproduced the simulation of the 2004 Tsunamigenic Sumatra earthquake with a highly optimized version of this software, called Shaking Corals. The effect that the Intel Skylake-based architecture has on the performance was investigated, as well as optimization strategies and scaling studies. Compared to the baseline simulation, an increase in speed and single node performance is shown. The total run time of Shaking Corals is measured with both local and global time stepping, and there is an inverse relationship between run time and total number of nodes. Due to the limited scale of data collection during the competition, it was not confirmed that the reduction of runtime for larger node counts mirrored the exponential decay observed in the original experiment."
