<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You are on a scientific research team developing software. Few or none of you are software developers by trade, and you have an overwhelmed grad
student taking charge of technical aspects of project development. Your project may be statistical, not programatic, so your testing needs to be
numerically manifold to asses it’s validity. Maybe you have heard of test cases, maybe you haven’t, but writing and learning to write
mountains of code to test your project is simply not a priority. This stuff takes to much time to learn, especially if you have more than
one undergraduate writing your test cases.</p>

<div id="solution" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Enter testsheets. Test sheets allows you to turn spreadsheets into [testthat] test cases via spreadsheets on Google Drive, or your local computer.
Both Google Sheets and Excel spreadsheets are supported.</p>
<p>and <em>This project is built on top of the well-documented, open source [tidyverse] packages [googledrive], [googlesheets4], and [readxl].</em></p>
