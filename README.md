# Personal Website

## Blogdown

I've been through many incomplete versions of personal websites, some entirely home-made dynamic sites, to Wordpress blogs. Nothing felt like it was truely meeting my needs as a low-maintenance, programatic, and aesthetic site. Then I started doing a lot of R development and I figured out that various forms of documentation in R-markdown are totally magical. From there I discovered bookdown, pkgdown, and blogdown, and the rest is... this static website!

## Academic

This site uses the Hugo theme, Academic, which I can't recommend enough to other research scientist and  research software engineers like myself.

## Awesome-CV

I have long used [@posquit0's](https://github.com/posquit0) [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) to create my CV and cover letter. I templated the main tex file with Pandoc a long time ago. Bookdown is built with the ability to implement some serious LaTeX, and right now I'm working on integrating the Awesome-CV template into the bookdown/hugo structure.
